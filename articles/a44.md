# Note Buying Strategies: A Comprehensive Guide

When it comes to real estate and investments, note buying is a strategy that can offer unique opportunities for investors. Whether you're new to the concept or an experienced investor looking to diversify your portfolio, understanding note buying strategies and the legal aspects involved is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the world of note buying strategies, provide insights into the relevant laws, and guide you on how to sell your note.

## What Are Note Buying Strategies?

Note buying, also known as mortgage note investing, involves purchasing the rights to receive mortgage payments from a borrower. This is often done by investors seeking a steady stream of income through the interest and principal payments made by the borrower. There are several strategies to consider within this niche:

### 1. Performing Notes vs. Non-Performing Notes

- **Performing Notes:** These are notes where the borrower is making regular, on-time payments. Investors can purchase these notes to enjoy a consistent stream of income. However, these notes typically yield lower returns compared to non-performing notes.

- **Non-Performing Notes:** Non-performing notes are loans where the borrower has defaulted on payments. Investors often buy non-performing notes at a discount, with the intention of either working out a solution with the borrower or foreclosing on the property to recover their investment.

### 2. First Position vs. Second Position Notes

- **First Position Notes:** These notes are secured by the first lien on the property. In the event of foreclosure, first position note holders have a higher chance of recovering their investment.

- **Second Position Notes:** These notes are junior liens on the property. Second position note holders are at a higher risk in the event of foreclosure but can purchase these notes at a discount.

### 3. Note Brokering

Note brokering involves acting as an intermediary between note buyers and sellers. Brokers earn a fee for facilitating the transaction, making it a viable strategy for those who want to be involved in the industry without holding the notes themselves.

## Laws Regarding Note Buying Strategies

The legality of note buying is subject to state and federal regulations, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Here are key legal aspects to consider:

### 1. Licensing Requirements

Some states require individuals and entities engaged in note buying to be licensed as mortgage loan originators or mortgage brokers. It's crucial to research your state's specific regulations to ensure compliance.

### 2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

Investors involved in debt collection activities, which can include pursuing payments on non-performing notes, must adhere to the FDCPA. This federal law outlines how debt collectors can interact with borrowers.

### 3. Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act introduced regulations to protect borrowers and promote responsible lending. It's important to understand how these regulations impact the note buying process, especially when dealing with owner-financed notes.

### 4. Due Diligence

Legal due diligence is crucial when buying mortgage notes. Understanding the terms of the original loan agreement, assessing the status of the borrower, and confirming the validity of the note are all essential to ensure a legal and successful transaction.

### 5. Eviction and Foreclosure Laws

In cases of non-performing notes, investors should be well-versed in state-specific eviction and foreclosure laws. These laws dictate the process for reclaiming the property and recouping the investment.
