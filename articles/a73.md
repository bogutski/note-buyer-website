# Note Buying Terms and Definitions

If you're considering entering the world of note buying, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the key terms and definitions that will help you navigate this intricate market. Note buying can be a lucrative investment strategy, but understanding the terminology is crucial for making informed decisions. In this article, we'll walk you through some of the fundamental note buying terms and definitions, and we'll also delve into the note buying process itself. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned investor, this information will prove valuable.

## Understanding Note Buying

### What Is a Promissory Note?

A promissory note is a legally binding document that represents a promise to pay a specified sum of money to a lender at a predetermined interest rate and over a defined period. This financial instrument serves as an essential part of the lending process and is the foundation of the note buying industry.

### Note Holder

The note holder is the individual or entity that owns the promissory note. They are entitled to receive the principal amount along with the agreed-upon interest payments from the borrower. Note holders can be individuals, banks, or investment companies.

### Mortgage Note

A mortgage note is a specific type of promissory note that is secured by real estate. It serves as evidence of a debt and the borrower's commitment to repay the loan, backed by the property. Mortgage notes are commonly bought and sold in the secondary market.

### Performing Note

A performing note is one in which the borrower is making regular, on-time payments as specified in the note's terms. These notes are often less risky and tend to have a higher market value compared to non-performing notes.

### Non-Performing Note

A non-performing note is a promissory note in which the borrower has fallen behind on payments or is in default. Investing in non-performing notes can offer the opportunity to acquire the underlying property at a discount, with the intention of resolving the default and getting the loan performing again.

### Due Diligence

Due diligence in note buying refers to the process of researching and evaluating a note or property thoroughly before making a purchase. It involves assessing factors like the borrower's creditworthiness, the property's value, and the legal aspects of the note.

### Loan to Value (LTV)

The loan-to-value ratio is a critical factor in note buying. It represents the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the underlying property. A lower LTV indicates a lower risk for the investor.

### Discounted Note

A discounted note is one that is sold for less than its face value. Investors purchase discounted notes to profit from the difference between the purchase price and the full value of the note when it is repaid.

### Exit Strategy

An exit strategy is a plan for how an investor intends to profit from a note. This can include strategies like holding the note for regular income, selling the note to another investor, or foreclosing on the property.

## The Note Buying Process

### Identifying Notes

The note buying process begins with identifying notes available for purchase. These can be found through various channels, including banks, brokers, online marketplaces, or direct marketing to note holders.

### Due Diligence

Once a potential note is identified, the investor conducts thorough due diligence. This involves reviewing the note's terms, the borrower's payment history, the property's condition and value, and any legal issues.

### Negotiation

Negotiation is a critical step in the note buying process. Investors may negotiate the purchase price, terms, and other conditions with the note seller. Skilled negotiation can significantly impact the investment's profitability.

### Purchase and Funding

After successful negotiation, the investor completes the purchase and secures the necessary funding. The purchase can be funded through personal funds, loans, or a combination of financing options.

### Managing the Note

Managing the note includes monitoring the borrower's payments, ensuring taxes and insurance are up to date, and addressing any issues that may arise. Effective management is essential to maximize the investment's return.

### Exit Strategy Execution

The final step in the note buying process is the execution of the chosen exit strategy. This could involve selling the note to another investor, foreclosing on the property, or holding the note for a consistent income stream.
