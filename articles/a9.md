## What is a Real Estate Contract?

Before we dive into the details of selling your real estate contract, let's understand what it is. A real estate contract, often known as a land contract or installment sale agreement, is a legal document used in real estate transactions. It outlines the terms and conditions for the purchase of a property, including the sale price, down payment, interest rate, and repayment schedule.

Real estate contracts are a versatile financial tool, allowing property buyers and sellers to create customized agreements that suit their unique circumstances. These contracts can be used to sell, purchase, or finance residential and commercial properties.
