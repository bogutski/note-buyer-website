## What is a partial mortgage note sale?

A partial mortgage note sale is the process of selling a portion of your mortgage note to an investor. This can be a good way to raise cash quickly or to reduce your risk exposure.

When you sell a partial mortgage note, you retain ownership of the remaining portion of the note. This means that you will continue to receive monthly payments from the borrower, but the investor will also receive a portion of the payments.

## Benefits of a partial mortgage note sale

* **Raise cash quickly**: Partial mortgage note sales can be a quick and easy way to raise cash. Investors are typically willing to purchase partial mortgage notes within a few weeks of receiving a request.
* **Reduce risk exposure**: By selling a portion of your mortgage note, you can reduce your risk exposure. If the borrower defaults on the loan, you will only lose the portion of the note that you sold.
* **Improve cash flow**: If you are struggling to make ends meet, selling a partial mortgage note can help to improve your cash flow. The monthly payments from the investor can help to cover your expenses.
* **Retain control**: When you sell a partial mortgage note, you retain ownership of the remaining portion of the note. This means that you still have a say in how the loan is serviced and that you will still receive a portion of the principal and interest payments.

## Risks of a partial mortgage note sale

* **Interest rate risk**: If interest rates rise, the value of your partial mortgage note may decline.
* **Liquidity risk**: It may be difficult to sell your partial mortgage note if you need to raise cash quickly.
* **Default risk**: The borrower may default on the loan, which means that you will lose the portion of the note that you sold.

## How to sell a partial mortgage note

To sell a partial mortgage note, you will need to find a buyer. There are a number of ways to find buyers, including:

* **Online note exchanges:** There are a number of online note exchanges that connect mortgage note sellers with investors.
* **Private mortgage lenders**: Private mortgage lenders may also be willing to purchase partial mortgage notes.
* **Financial advisors**: Financial advisors can help you to find buyers for your partial mortgage note.

Once you have found a buyer, you will need to negotiate the terms of the sale. This will include the price of the note, the interest rate, and the payment terms.

## Fractional note investing

Fractional note investing is a type of investment that allows investors to purchase partial mortgage notes. This can be a good way to invest in mortgage notes without having to purchase a whole note.

There are a number of different ways to invest in fractional notes. One option is to invest through a fractional note investment platform. These platforms pool together money from investors and purchase partial mortgage notes on their behalf.

Another option is to invest in fractional notes directly from a mortgage note seller. This can be a more complex option, but it can also be more rewarding.

## Conclusion

Partial mortgage note selling can be a good way to raise cash quickly, reduce your risk exposure, or improve your cash flow. However, there are also some risks associated with partial mortgage note selling. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks before deciding whether or not to sell a partial mortgage note.
